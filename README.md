#Creating web APIs with plumber


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to Plumber, which is an open-source R package that converts your existing R code into a web API. Having the ability to do this enables you to leverage your R code from other platforms or programing languages. Plumber could be used to insert a graph created in R into a website, or even to run a forecast model on some data from your computer!

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to: 
(1) Equip you with conceptual knowledge about the plumber package and API's. 
(2) Show you some of the plumber pipeline. 
(3) Provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
